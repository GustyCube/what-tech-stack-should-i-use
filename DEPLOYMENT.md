# 🚀 Cloudflare Workers Deployment Guide

## Setup Complete ✅

Your Next.js app is now configured for Cloudflare Workers deployment!

## 📁 What Was Created

- **`worker.js`** - Workers runtime script that handles routing
- **`wrangler.toml`** - Cloudflare Workers configuration
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - This deployment guide

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Build for Workers
npm run workers:build

# Local development with Workers
npm run workers:dev

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run workers:deploy
```

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare
```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### 2. Deploy to Workers
```bash
npm run workers:deploy
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### `wrangler.toml`
- **name**: `wtssiu` - Your worker name
- **main**: `worker.js` - Entry point script
- **bucket**: `./out` - Static files directory (from Next.js export)
- **compatibility_date**: `2024-01-01`

### `worker.js`
- Handles static asset routing (`/_next/static/`, etc.)
- Serves `index.html` for all SPA routes
- Proper content-type headers for HTML

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Static Assets**: Direct passthrough for JS, CSS, images
2. **App Routes**: All other routes serve the main `index.html`
3. **Client-side Routing**: React Router handles navigation in browser

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Your app exports as static files (`output: 'export'`)
- Server-side features (API routes, SSR) won't work in Workers
- All data fetching must be client-side
- Images are unoptimized for static hosting

## 📊 What Gets Deployed

```
out/
├── index.html          # Main app entry
├── _next/static/       # JS, CSS bundles
├── favicon.ico         # Static assets
└── ...                 # Other static files
```

## 🔄 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Add this to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run workers:deploy
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
```

## 🎯 Performance

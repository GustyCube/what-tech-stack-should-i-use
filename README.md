> **An intelligent tech stack recommendation system that uses information theory to find your perfect development stack in 3-4 questions**

## ✨ What Makes This Special?

Unlike traditional decision trees that ask generic questions, WTSSIU uses **Akinator-style binary search** to intelligently narrow down tech stacks:

- 🧠 **Smart Question Selection**: Uses information theory to ask the most discriminating questions first
- ⚡ **3-4 Questions Max**: Gets to your perfect stack faster than any other tool
- 🎯 **50/50 Split Strategy**: Each question eliminates ~50% of remaining options
- 📊 **Real-time Progress**: See exactly how many stacks remain after each answer
- 🔄 **Dynamic Algorithm**: Questions adapt based on your previous answers

## 🚀 How It Works

### Traditional Approach vs. WTSSIU

| Traditional Decision Trees | WTSSIU Smart Algorithm |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Fixed question order | Dynamic question selection |
| 6-8 questions typical | 3-4 questions maximum |
| Generic categories first | Most discriminating questions first |
| Static tree traversal | Information-theoretic optimization |

### The Algorithm

```typescript
// 1. Calculate information gain for each possible question
function calculateInformationGain(question, remainingStacks) {
  // Group stacks by their likely answers
  const groups = groupStacksByAnswer(question, remainingStacks);
  
  // Calculate entropy to find questions that split 50/50
  return entropy_before - entropy_after;
}

// 2. Always ask the question with highest information gain
const bestQuestion = questions.reduce((best, current) => 
  calculateInformationGain(current, stacks) > 
  calculateInformationGain(best, stacks) ? current : best
);

// 3. Filter remaining stacks based on answer
remainingStacks = filterStacksByAnswer(stacks, question, answer);
```

## 🎮 Example Flow

Instead of asking "Frontend, Backend, or Full-stack?" first, WTSSIU might ask:

1. **"Is this primarily a frontend/UI project?"** → Eliminates 50% immediately
2. **"Do you prefer the JavaScript ecosystem?"** → Down to 25% of stacks  
3. **"Working solo or with a small team?"** → Down to 12% of stacks
4. **"Do you need database integration?"** → Final recommendation!

**Result**: Your perfect tech stack in 4 questions instead of 8+ 🎯

## 🤝 Contributing

We love contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Add New Tech Stacks**: Update `tree.json` with new recommendations
2. **Improve Questions**: Add smarter discriminating questions to `smart-tree-walker.ts`
3. **Better Scoring**: Enhance the `scoringFn` for existing questions
4. **UI/UX**: Improve the user experience and visual design

### Adding a New Stack

```typescript
// Add to smart-tree-walker.ts
{
  id: 'new_question',
  text: 'Your discriminating question?',
  type: 'boolean',
  options: ['Yes', 'No'],
  scoringFn: (stack) => {
    // Return 1 if stack matches this criteria, 0 if not
    return stack.tags.includes('your-criteria') ? 1 : 0;
  }
}
```

## 📈 Analytics & Insights

WTSSIU tracks (anonymously):
- Question effectiveness and information gain
- User completion rates and drop-off points  
- Most popular tech stack recommendations
- Algorithm performance metrics

## 🏆 Why Information Theory?

Traditional decision trees follow predetermined paths. WTSSIU uses **Claude Shannon's information theory** to:

- **Maximize Information Gain**: Each question eliminates the maximum number of possibilities
- **Minimize Decision Time**: Reach conclusions in `log₂(n)` questions where n = number of stacks
- **Adapt Dynamically**: Questions change based on remaining possibilities
- **Optimize User Experience**: Reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue
